      <h2>Our Journey 🌱</h2>
      <p>We met in 5th grade but didn't talk much... until that 9th class math assembly when it all began. From secret notes in lockers to dreams of joining the same college, it’s been such a beautiful ride!</p>
      <p>You’ve always been there: encouraging me, making me laugh, chatting until 3AM, and being the first to say sorry after fights. You're a gem of a friend, Mady. 💖</p>

    <div class="teasing-box">
      <h2>Grandpa & Monkey Vibes 🐵👴</h2>
      <p>I’ll never forget teasing you about walking slowly from the terrace or calling you ‘old’. And you calling me Grandpa—it’s a memory I cherish with a smile every time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wish-box">
      <h2>My Wish For You 🌈</h2>
      <p>I truly wish you succeed in every single thing you dream of. May you always stay happy, strong, and full of energy (even if you’re getting “old” 😛).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="apology-box">
      <h2>From Me </h2>
      <p>Sorry if I ever hurt you. I’m trying to manage my anger better, and I promise to grow. Thank you for always listening, even to my midnight rants. You’ve done more for me than anyone ever has.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="footer">
      <p>Can we please go to the same university? I want to bug you more, monkey! 🙈</p>
